# BreastCancer
The dataset is taken from Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets from the UCI Machine LearningRepository.
Procedure:1. Acquire dataset from Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets from the UCI Machine LearningRepository.2. Pre-process data for applying Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and Naive Bayes.Remove Sample Code Number from attribute listSet output variable as nominal.3. Loading relevant packages.4. Doing some exploratory analysis.5. Diving the dataset into training and testing data.6. Implementing the three algorithms where the class label is the output variable.7. Diagnosis of testing set observations based on each of the model8. Computing the accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure.
